Text Mask is an input mask library. It works with any JavaScript framework.
There are convenient wrappers for React and Angular 2. And I need help creating wrappers for other frameworks,
like Ember, Vue, Knockout, or anything else. If you can help, [email me](mailto:msafi@msafi.com)!

Text Mask can create input masks for phone, date, currency, zip code, and anything else!

## Live demo

See it in action, [check out the demo page](https://msafi.github.io/text-mask/).

## Installation and usage

* [React](react#readme)
* [Angular 2](angular2#readme)
* [Vanilla JS](vanilla#readme)

## Expected to work with...

IE9+, Android, Samsung Internet, Windows Phone, iOS, Opera, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome

## Flexible

Text Mask is very configurable and allows you to create any type of input mask with very minimal APIs.
[See the documentation for details](https://github.com/msafi/text-mask/blob/master/componentDocumentation.md#readme).

## Robust

Text Mask supports pasting, browser auto-fill, and all operations that a user would expect while interacting with
an input field.

It works on mobile, has no 3rd party dependencies, and has a tiny footprint (less than 4KB gzipped).
