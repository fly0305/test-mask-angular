## Why

`string-pattern` may have a few temporary short-comings, but it's still totally worth your time
because:

* It works
* It has a bunch of [unit tests](https://github.com/msafi/string-pattern/tree/master/test)
* It's small
* It's designed to be less disruptive, and make the user feel that they're interacting
with a plain `input` HTML element
* It's powered by a couple of short algorithms only, which makes it less brittle
* You'll look like a cool hipster for being the only one who uses it :P
