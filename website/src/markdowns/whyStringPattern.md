## Why

`string-pattern` has a few short-comings. But it's still totally worth your time, I think, because:

* It works
* It has a bunch of [unit tests](https://github.com/msafi/string-pattern/tree/master/test)
* It's small
* It's designed to be least disruptive to normal user interactions with the `input` element
* It's powered by a couple of short algorithms only, which makes it less brittle
* You'll look like a cool hipster for being the only one who uses it!
