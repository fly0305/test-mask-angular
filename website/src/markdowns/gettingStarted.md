## Getting started

#### React

If you're using React, see the [getting started steps for React](#/react).

#### Vanilla JS

If you would like to turn a vanilla `<input>` element into a masked input, see these
[getting started steps](#/vanilla).

Or if you're feeling adventerous, you can use the core functions of Text Mask to create a wrapper
for your own front-end setup. Start by checking out the [core module](#/core).
