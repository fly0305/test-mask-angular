## Why use this library

* It works
* It's actively maintained
* It's small
* It has a bunch of unit tests
* It's designed to be less disruptive, and make the user feel that they're interacting
with a plain `input` HTML element
* It's powered by a couple of short algorithms only, which makes it less brittle
* You'll look like a cool hipster for being the only one who uses it :P
