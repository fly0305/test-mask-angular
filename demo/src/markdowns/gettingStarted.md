## Getting started

I will make `string-pattern` easier to use, and I will write a proper getting started guide,
but for now, if you're using React, Babel, and webpack, the following instructions may
be sufficient.

First...

```
npm i string-pattern --save
```

Then, in the file where you wanna use it...

```
import {
  convertPatternToPlaceholder,
  conformToPattern,
  adjustCaretPosition
} from 'string-pattern'

```

And...

* See the source code of this component for how `string-pattern` can be used with React,
* read the API documentation, and
* if interested in more, read about how it works.
